# Reports and analysis

You can use CiviReport or CiviCRM's search features for reporting on and
analysing contributions.

## Contribution reports

Out of the box, CiviCRM comes with thirteen contribution reports
designed to help you analyse your contributions.

A **contribution summary report** allows you to group contributions by
different criteria including the contact that made the
contribution, time period, type, location and view summary statistics
for these contributions. The accompanying **contribution detail
report** is automatically called when clicking on any rows from the
summary report. It can also be called on its own to provide a detailed
report for a specific subset of contributions. These two reports can be
useful for analyses such as what percentage of our income is coming from
different fundraising campaigns, or from events vs. memberships, etc.

The **repeat contribution report** compares the total amount of
contributions that contacts have made in two different time periods. As
well as the totals, it shows the percentage increase/decrease. This
report is useful for tracking contacts who have stepped up their giving,
or who are giving less than before. **SYBUNT report** AND **LYBUNT report** are two
strangely named but useful reports that allow you to
find donors that gave in 'some years / last year but not this year'.

Two reports, the **contribution by household report** and **contribution
by organisation report** allow you to aggregate contributions by household or
organisation. This is useful for
organisations that make use of these two concepts. For example, you can
see all contributions that have been made by employees of one
organisation and thank them as a whole, or see the contributions made by
a particularly active family. These reports will also include any
donations that are attached to the organisation or household record, for
example a donation made by the organisation after a collective office
fundraising event.

The **top donors report** provides a list of the top donors during a time
period you define. You can include as many donors as you want (for
example, top 100 of your donors). If you leave the **Show no. of Top Donors**
field empty the report will include all contacts included by the other filters.  

The **personal campaign page report** is useful to get an overview of
the status of all personal campaign pages. You can filter by
contribution page to see personal campaign pages for a single campaign
and other appropriate criteria.

The **soft credit report** is useful for looking at all your soft
credits and seeing who are at least partially responsible for other
people's donations.

The **contribution aggregate by relationship report** lists a contact's
donation history, grouped by year, along with contributions attributed
to any of the contact's related contacts.

The **recurring contributions report** provides information about the
status of recurring contributions.

The **bookkeeping transactions report** provides transaction details for
all payments, including financial type and accounts, transaction number,
invoice ID, payment instrument and check number.

## More analysis

These standard reports has been configured to display particular information
and they may not provide what you need. You can
[download and install extensions](https://civicrm.org/extensions) to access
additional reports. If you still can't extract the information you need,
consider commissioning a new report or custom search and contributing it back
to the community.
