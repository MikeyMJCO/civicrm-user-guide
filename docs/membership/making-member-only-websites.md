# Making member only websites

CiviMember can be used in conjunction with your CMS to create a
members-only section of your website. Each CMS has it's own integration
module(s) that can be used to do this. A typical workflow would be that
a contact creates an account on your site and becomes a member of your
organisation using a CiviMember membership sign up page. When they log
in to you site they get access to member-only content on your site.
This extra content could be from your CMS or it could come from your
CRM, for example a detailed members directory, or a list of private
events that are only available to members. You can refer to the section
on your CMS in *Website Integration* for more information or ask
questions on [http://forum.civicrm.org/](http://forum.civicrm.org/).
